8476,You Can Smell Hillaryâ€™s Fear,"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
In the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. 
The word â€œunprecedentedâ€ has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But itâ€™s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. 
But thatâ€™s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillaryâ€™s opponent in this election. 
The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillaryâ€™s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldnâ€™t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. 
The FBIâ€™s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBIâ€™s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. 
The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obamaâ€™s DOJ people has gone explosively public. 
The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, â€œJames Comey Role Recalls Hooverâ€™s FBI, Fairly or Notâ€ practically admits up front that itâ€™s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comeyâ€™s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. 
James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the â€œvast right wing conspiracyâ€ was a stretch. 
Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know whatâ€™s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. 
Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. 
If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. 
Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weinerâ€™s computer? 
Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or heâ€™s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillaryâ€™s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. 
The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. 
And itâ€™s an interesting question. 
Hillaryâ€™s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. 
Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. 
There are two possible explanations. 
Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. 
But the other explanation is that her people panicked. 
Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. Itâ€™s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, thatâ€™s not hubris, itâ€™s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. 
During the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the â€œpositiveâ€ Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. 
Thereâ€™s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. 
The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so itâ€™s gone all in on fighting the FBI. Itâ€™s an unprecedented step born of fear. Itâ€™s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. 
Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. 
You can smell the fear. 
The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. Itâ€™s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All thatâ€™s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isnâ€™t how you react to smoke. Itâ€™s how you respond to a fire. 
The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. 
The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they donâ€™t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. 
The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. Itâ€™s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. Itâ€™s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. 
Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But sheâ€™s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.  ",FAKE
10294,Watch The Exact Moment Paul Ryan Committed Political Suicide At A Trump Rally (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. 
In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : â€œRepublicans, it is time to come homeâ€ https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I 
â€” ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 
The Democratic Party couldnâ€™t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryanâ€™s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryanâ€™s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. 
The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a â€œprincipledâ€ conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trumpâ€™s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan â€“ like many of his colleagues â€“ turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. 
Whatâ€™s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didnâ€™t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. 
If 2016â€™s very ugly election has done any good itâ€™s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events.

3608,Kerry to go to Paris in gesture of sympathy,"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sundayâ€™s unity march against terrorism.

Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.

The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.

The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sundayâ€™s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.

Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.

Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by Indiaâ€™s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modiâ€™s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.

In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as â€œquibbling a little bit.â€ He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.

â€œBut that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,â€ he said.

â€œAnd I donâ€™t think the people of France have any doubts about Americaâ€™s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.â€",REAL

While Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaksâ€™ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clintonâ€™s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. 
Rather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nomineeâ€™s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clintonâ€™s unfavorable ratings. According to RealClearPolitics, anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. 
As of 11 PM Eastern, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Clinton has 197 electoral votes to Trumpâ€™s 187.

875,The Battle of New York: Why This Primary Matters,"It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.

Trump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.

A big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.

""We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!"" Sanders recently told supporters.

While wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.

Trump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.

""We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,"" Trump urged supporters.

Meanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.

Despite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.

""Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,"" Cruz promised his supporters. ""We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.""

For now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.",REAL
6903,"Tehran, USA","  
Iâ€™m not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. 
What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, Iâ€™ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. 
In Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders â€” of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry â€” Islamophobia â€” threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, Iâ€™ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
â€œDeath to America!â€ 
As a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of â€œDeath to America!â€ That day would define the rest of my life. 
It was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting â€œDeath to America!â€ I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. 
In a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the schoolâ€™s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us â€” if we ever wanted to see our families again â€” to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, â€œDeath to America!â€ as they stomped on our sacred symbols. 
I was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldnâ€™t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. 
Across the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmateâ€™s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for â€” or against. 
â€œCamel Jockey,â€ â€œAyatollah,â€ and â€œGandhiâ€ 
My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including â€œcamel jockey,â€ â€œsand-nigger,â€ â€œraghead,â€ â€œayatollah,â€ and ironically, â€œGandhiâ€ (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to â€œother-izeâ€ me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. 
Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform â€” all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or thatâ€™s how I felt anyway as I wore my countryâ€™s uniform. 
When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. 
Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it werenâ€™t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. 
Through patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the â€œothernessâ€ of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. 
In 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. 
In the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist â€œus vs. themâ€ attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. 
By the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam â€” or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. 
For the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in Americaâ€™s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. 
The Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up 
On February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as â€œa monster.â€ Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. 
The incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. 
At that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help â€” and itâ€™s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon â€” and I, of course, joined it. 
From that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and thatâ€™s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. Weâ€™ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. 
Our group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. 
Nationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, donâ€™t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a â€œclash of civilizations.â€ Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an â€œus vs. themâ€ and itâ€™s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. 
As of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the â€œother,â€ the enemy. 
My Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isnâ€™t just a matter of niceties. Itâ€™s a question of life or death. Itâ€™s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. 
In many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. Itâ€™s just that now Iâ€™m doing it in my own country.

7341,Girl Horrified At What She Watches Boyfriend Do After He Left FaceTime On,"Share This Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) 
The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, whoâ€™s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular â€œdatesâ€ this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. 
Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. 
According to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yaleâ€™s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didnâ€™t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Bayleeâ€™s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. 
Admitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. â€œI was scared, because they were saying Iâ€™m going to blow your head off, Iâ€™m going to kill you,â€ Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. â€œIâ€™m like wowâ€¦ seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,â€ she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror 
With a clear view of at least one intruderâ€™s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yaleâ€™s music equipment. Although the boyfriendâ€™s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that canâ€™t be replaced. 
â€œI had just finished my first album as a solo artist,â€ Yale said. â€œThatâ€™s all lost,â€ since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. Itâ€™s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case.

Dubbed â€œBritainâ€™s Schindler,â€ Nicholas Winton arranged to transport Jewish youngsters from Prague after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Though the children were originally set to arrive in Britain by plane, the German invasion forced Winton to transport them by train through Germany before they eventually reached England by boat. Winton arranged eight trains, known as the Kindertransports (childrenâ€™s transports), to evacuate the children, and died on the anniversary of the 1939 departure of the one carrying the largest number of children: 241. Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for his efforts, despite keeping it secret for nearly 50 years.",REAL
4869,Fact check: Trump and Clinton at the 'commander-in-chief' forum,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC â€œcommander-in-chiefâ€ forum on military and veterans issues:

â€¢ Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started, while Trump was wrong, once again, in saying he was against the war before it started.

â€¢Â Trump said that President Obama set a â€œcertain dateâ€ for withdrawing troops from Iraq, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.

â€¢Â Trump said that Obamaâ€™s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were â€œthe first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force Oneâ€ when â€œhigh officialsâ€ of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true.

â€¢Â Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. Thatâ€™s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.

â€¢Â Trump said Clinton made â€œa terrible mistake on Libyaâ€ when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.

â€¢Â Trump cherry-picked Clintonâ€™s words when he claimed Clinton said â€œvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.â€ Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as â€œwidespreadâ€ as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.

The forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. TodayÂ show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.

Trump said he â€œwas totally against the war in Iraq,â€ while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts donâ€™t support either candidateâ€™s strong assertions.

Our review of Trumpâ€™s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 â€” about six months before the war started.

Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, â€œYeah, I guess so.â€

In the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.

As for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump â€œsupported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.â€

But just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war â€œafter it happened.â€

The Clinton campaign cited Trumpâ€™s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.

Cavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war â€œlooks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,â€ and he predicted the market will â€œgo up like a rocketâ€ after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesnâ€™t offer an opinion.

As early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris MatthewsÂ about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBCâ€™s Joe Scarborough, â€œI guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.â€

Clinton invited her audience to read Trumpâ€™s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, â€œDonald Trump and the Iraq War.â€

Trump said President Obama set a â€œcertain dateâ€ for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.

NBCâ€™s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that heâ€™s not going to give details because he wants to be â€œunpredictable.â€ Trump responded, â€œAbsolutely,â€ and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.

As we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: â€œAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.â€

In the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops â€œa terrible decision.â€ As weâ€™ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bushâ€™s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.

Once Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didnâ€™t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didnâ€™t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasnâ€™t a deal to be made with Maliki.

So, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a â€œcertain dateâ€ for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.

Itâ€™s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.

Trump said that Obamaâ€™s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were â€œthe first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force Oneâ€ when â€œhigh officialsâ€ of a host country did not appear to greet the president.

Thatâ€™s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.

Trump referred to the fact that Cubaâ€™s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabiaâ€™s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obamaâ€™s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to Chinaâ€™s handling of the presidentâ€™s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.

Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.

In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by Chinaâ€™s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Postâ€˜s â€œFact Checker,â€ who researched a Trump claim in April that Cubaâ€™s and Saudi Arabiaâ€™s handling of Obamaâ€™s visits were â€œwithout precedent.â€ Kessler said of Trump, â€œonce again heâ€™s wrong, wrong, wrong.â€

Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixonâ€™s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the countryâ€™s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didnâ€™t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.

Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.

But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. â€œI would not do that,â€ Trump said, referring to Clintonâ€™s claim that he supports privatization.

Trumpâ€™s campaign published â€œThe Goals Of Donald J. Trumpâ€™s Veterans Planâ€ on its website last October. It doesnâ€™t call for the VA to be completely privatized.

One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.

â€œUnder a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteranâ€™s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,â€ the plan states.

â€œThe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veteransâ€™ healthcare dollars,â€ the plan says.

Trumpâ€™s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.

Trumpâ€™s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.

Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent â€œTen Point Plan To Reform The VAâ€ in July.

Point 10 of the plan says: â€œMr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.â€

Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.

To be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. Thatâ€™s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.

Trump criticized Clinton for making â€œa terrible mistake on Libyaâ€ when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.

Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be â€œprepared on Day One,â€ if elected president, to tackle â€œcomplex national security issues.â€

This isnâ€™t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.

During the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had â€œnever discussed that subjectâ€ when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya â€œon a humanitarian basisâ€ and â€œknock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.â€

Trump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:

Even though Trump now says Clintonâ€™s support for intervention in Libya was a â€œterrible mistake,â€ it doesnâ€™t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafiâ€™s removal.

Trump twisted Clintonâ€™s words when he claimed Clinton said â€œvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.â€ Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as â€œwidespreadâ€ as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system â€” including the issue of wait times for doctors â€” and what she would do to address them.

Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as â€œone of the big problemsâ€ in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesnâ€™t think the VA has problems.

Lauer interrupted, noting that Clinton â€œwent on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.â€

Trump insisted his version was accurate, adding, â€œIâ€™m telling you â€¦ she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.â€

Thatâ€™s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBCâ€™s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. â€œThe reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,â€ Maddow said.

Maddow asked if Clinton had any â€œnew ideas for trying to fixâ€ the VA. Here was Clintonâ€™s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.

Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they â€œwant it to failâ€ so they can privatize it.

Clinton added, â€œBut we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.â€

Indeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to â€œfundamentally reform veteransâ€™ health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.â€ The campaign says Clinton â€œwas outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.â€ The site specifically mentions Clintonâ€™s dissatisfaction that â€œ[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appealsâ€ and promises she will â€œ[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.â€

Trump cherry-picked the part of Clintonâ€™s response that said problems in the VA have â€œnot been as widespread as it has been made out to be,â€ to make the blanket claim that Clinton is â€œsatisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administrationâ€ and that â€œvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.â€ But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clintonâ€™s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA â€” including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.",REAL
2909,Iran reportedly makes new push for uranium concessions in nuclear talks,"Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.

The New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas, but could be disposed of in other ways.

The new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.

However, if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country, it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia, it would have been converted into fuel rods, which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.

The Associated Press reported Sunday that Iran's position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to keep 6,000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.

The United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However, The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen, former head of inspections for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6,500 centrifuges.

Tehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.

Officials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks â€” Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany â€” insist on progressive removal after a decade.

A senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.

Limits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said.

Tehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Iran's programs are lifted.

One official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.

Both Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.

There was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons.

Iran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said.

With the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan.

Kerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday.
