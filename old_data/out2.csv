10294,watch the exact moment paul ryan committed political suicide at a trump rally (video),|google pinterest digg linkedin reddit stumbleupon print delicious pocket tumblr there are two fundamental truths in this world: paul ryan desperately wants to be president . and paul ryan will never be president . today proved it . in a particularly staggering example of political cowardice , paul ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the trump train after all . this was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago . he had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending trump after a tape was made public in which trump bragged about assaulting women . suddenly , ryan was appearing at a pro-trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him president of the united states . it was a surreal moment . the figurehead of the republican party dosed himself in gasoline , got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in wisconsin , and lit a match . . @speakerryan says he voted for @realdonaldtrump : aeuroerepublicans , it is time to come homeaeur https://t . co/vytt49yvoe pic . twitter . com/wcvscg4a5i aeur" abc news politics ( @abcpolitics ) november 5 , 2016 the democratic party couldnaeur ( tm ) t have asked for a better moment of film . ryanaeur ( tm ) s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant . in the wreckage trump is to leave behind in his wake , those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover . if ryanaeur ( tm ) s career manages to limp all the way to 2020 , then the dnc will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until election day . the ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness . ryan has postured himself as a aeuroeprincipledaeur conservative , and one uncomfortable with trumpaeur ( tm ) s unapologetic bigotry and sexism . however , when push came to shove , paul ryan aeur" like many of his colleagues aeur" turned into a sniveling appeaser . after all his lofty tak about conviction , his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze . whataeur ( tm ) s especially bizarre is how close ryan came to making it through unscathed . for months the speaker of the house refused to comment on trump at all . his strategy seemed to be to keep his head down , pretend trump didnaeur ( tm ) t exist , and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016 . now , just days away from the election , he screwed it all up . if 2016aeur ( tm ) s very ugly election has done any good itaeur ( tm ) s by exposing the utter cowardice of the republicans who once feigned moral courage . a reality television star spit on them , hijacked their party , insulted their wives , and got every last one of them to kneel before him . what a turn of events . featured image via twitter|,FAKE
4869,fact check: trump and clinton at the 'commander-in-chief' forum,|hillary clinton and donald trump made some inaccurate claims during an nbc aeuroecommander-in-chiefaeur forum on military and veterans issues: aeurc/ clinton wrongly claimed trump supported the war in iraq after it started , while trump was wrong , once again , in saying he was against the war before it started . aeurc/a trump said that president obama set a aeuroecertain dateaeur for withdrawing troops from iraq , when that date was set before obama was sworn in . aeurc/a trump said that obamaaeur ( tm ) s visits to china , saudi arabia and cuba were aeuroethe first time in the history , the storied history of air force oneaeur when aeuroehigh officialsaeur of a host country did not appear to greet the president . not true . aeurc/a clinton said that trump supports privatizing the veterans health administration . thataeur ( tm ) s false . trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals . aeurc/a trump said clinton made aeuroea terrible mistake on libyaaeur when she was secretary of state . but , at the time , trump also supported u . s . action that led to the removal of moammar gadhafi from power . aeurc/a trump cherry-picked clintonaeur ( tm ) s words when he claimed clinton said aeuroevets are being treated , essentially , just fine . aeur clinton had said the problems in the department of veterans affairs were not as aeuroewidespreadaeur as some republicans claimed , but she went on to acknowledge problems , including the issue of wait times for doctors . the forum , sponsored by nbc news and the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america , was held sept . 7 at the intrepid sea , air & space museum in new york city . todaya show host matt lauer , and members of the military and veterans in the audience , questioned the candidates separately . trump said he aeuroewas totally against the war in iraq , aeur while clinton claimed that he supported the iraq war before and after it started . the facts donaeur ( tm ) t support either candidateaeur ( tm ) s strong assertions . our review of trumpaeur ( tm ) s statements before and after the iraq war started found no evidence that trump opposed the war before it started . in fact , he expressed mild support for invading iraq when asked about it on the howard stern radio show on sept . 11 , 2002 aeur" about six months before the war started . stern asked trump if he supported a war with iraq , and trump responded , aeuroeyeah , i guess so . aeur in the nbc commander in chief forum , trump cited an esquire article that appeared in august 2004 to show his opposition to the war . but that article appeared 17 months after the war started . as for clinton , who as a senator voted in october 2002 to authorize the war in iraq , the democratic nominee claimed that trump aeuroesupported it before it happened , he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened . aeur but just as there is no evidence that trump opposed the iraq war before it started , the clinton campaign offered no evidence that trump supported the war aeuroeafter it happened . aeur the clinton campaign cited trumpaeur ( tm ) s interview on march 21 , 2003 , with neil cavuto of fox business just two days after the war started . cavuto asked trump about the impact of the war on the stock market . trump said the war aeuroelooks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint , aeur and he predicted the market will aeuroego up like a rocketaeur after the war . but cavuto does not ask trump whether the u . s . should have gone to war with iraq or whether he supports the war , and trump doesnaeur ( tm ) t offer an opinion . as early as july 2003 , trump expressed concern on hardball with chris matthewsa about money being spent in iraq rather than in the u . s . two months later , trump told msnbcaeur ( tm ) s joe scarborough , aeuroei guess maybe if i had to do it , i would have fought terrorism but not necessarily iraq . aeur clinton invited her audience to read trumpaeur ( tm ) s comments on the iraq war . they can read our timeline , aeuroedonald trump and the iraq war . aeur trump said president obama set a aeuroecertain dateaeur for withdrawing troops from iraq , but that date was actually set by president george w . bush . nbcaeur ( tm ) s matt lauer asked trump about his tendency to respond , when pushed for details on his military proposals , that heaeur ( tm ) s not going to give details because he wants to be aeuroeunpredictable . aeur trump responded , aeuroeabsolutely , aeur and went on to criticize obama for revealing the withdrawal date . as we said then , republicans and democrats disagree on whether obama or bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from iraq at the end of 2011 . but that date was set when bush signed the status of forces agreement on dec . 14 , 2008 . it said: aeuroeall the united states forces shall withdraw from all iraqi territory no later than december 31 , 2011 . aeur in the nbc forum , trump also called the withdrawal of troops aeuroea terrible decision . aeur as weaeur ( tm ) ve explained before , condoleezza rice , bushaeur ( tm ) s secretary of state , later wrote that bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain , but iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki objected . once obama took office in january 2009 , he had three years to renegotiate the deal , which his administration tried to do , to leave a residual american troop force . but maliki still didnaeur ( tm ) t agree . negotiations broke down in october 2011 over the issue of whether u . s . troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by iraqi authorities . whether obama did enough is a matter of opinion: his then defense secretary , leon panetta , later wrote that the president didnaeur ( tm ) t press hard enough for a deal . but some experts say iraq was more closely aligned at the time with iran and there wasnaeur ( tm ) t a deal to be made with maliki . so , both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops . but trump wrongly said that obama was the one who set a aeuroecertain dateaeur for withdrawal and let u . s . enemies know about it , when that date was set before obama was sworn in . itaeur ( tm ) s worth noting that trump said in a march 16 , 2007 , interview on cnn that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from iraq . trump said that obamaaeur ( tm ) s visits to china , saudi arabia and cuba were aeuroethe first time in the history , the storied history of air force oneaeur when aeuroehigh officialsaeur of a host country did not appear to greet the president . thataeur ( tm ) s not true . other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft . trump referred to the fact that cubaaeur ( tm ) s president , raul castro , did not greet obama at the airport on his historic visit to cuba in march , that saudi arabiaaeur ( tm ) s king salman did not meet air force one at the start of obamaaeur ( tm ) s trip to riyadh in april , and he referred to chinaaeur ( tm ) s handling of the presidentaeur ( tm ) s arrival in hangzhou last saturday for a group of 20 meeting . whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a u . s . president as trump claims is a matter of debate . but trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before . it has . in 1984 , for example , ronald reagan landed in beijing and was received by chinaaeur ( tm ) s foreign minister rather than the president , whom he met only later . similarly , on a 1985 trip to west germany , reagan was met by the foreign minister and not chancellor helmut kohl . these and other examples were dug up by our friend glenn kessler , the washington postaeur~s aeuroefact checker , aeur who researched a trump claim in april that cubaaeur ( tm ) s and saudi arabiaaeur ( tm ) s handling of obamaaeur ( tm ) s visits were aeuroewithout precedent . aeur kessler said of trump , aeuroeonce again heaeur ( tm ) s wrong , wrong , wrong . aeur kessler also noted that during richard nixonaeur ( tm ) s historic 1972 visit to china he was greeted at the airport by the countryaeur ( tm ) s number two man , premier zhou enlai . his boss , chairman mao , didnaeur ( tm ) t even agree to meet with nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house . clinton said that her plan to overhaul the veterans health administration would not include privatization , which she said trump supports . but trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans . aeuroei would not do that , aeur trump said , referring to clintonaeur ( tm ) s claim that he supports privatization . trumpaeur ( tm ) s campaign published aeuroethe goals of donald j . trumpaeur ( tm ) s veterans planaeur on its website last october . it doesnaeur ( tm ) t call for the va to be completely privatized . one of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current va health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-va medical center that accepts medicare . aeuroeunder a trump administration , all veterans eligible for va health care can bring their veteranaeur ( tm ) s id card to any doctor or care facility that accepts medicare to get the care they need immediately , aeur the plan states . aeuroethe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the va to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veteransaeur ( tm ) healthcare dollars , aeur the plan says . trumpaeur ( tm ) s proposal would seemingly go further than the non-va medical care program , which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the va under certain circumstances , such as when va medical centers cannot provide services . the program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-va facility in non-emergency situations . trumpaeur ( tm ) s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan veterans choice act of 2014 that president obama signed into law , creating a temporary program , separate from the non-va medical care program , that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-va facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a va medical center , or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest va hospital . trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent aeuroeten point plan to reform the vaaeur in july . point 10 of the plan says: aeuroemr . trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the va or at a private service provider of their own choice . under a trump administration , no veteran will die waiting for service . aeur trump reinforced that part of his plan during the nbc news forum as well . to be clear , trump supports giving veterans a choice between va hospitals and private ones . thataeur ( tm ) s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans . trump criticized clinton for making aeuroea terrible mistake on libyaaeur when she was secretary of state . but , at the time , trump also supported u . s . action that led to the removal of moammar gadhafi from power . trump made his claim in response to a question posed by lauer on whether trump will be aeuroeprepared on day one , aeur if elected president , to tackle aeuroecomplex national security issues . aeur this isnaeur ( tm ) t the first time trump has ignored his past support for the u . s . intervention in libya . during the 10th gop debate , trump said he had aeuroenever discussed that subjectaeur when sen . ted cruz called him out on supporting u . s . action in the country . but , as we wrote , trump said in 2011 that the u . s . should go into libya aeuroeon a humanitarian basisaeur and aeuroeknock [gadhafi] out very quickly , very surgically , very effectively and save the lives . aeur trump made that comment in a video posted to his youtube channel in february 2011: even though trump now says clintonaeur ( tm ) s support for intervention in libya was a aeuroeterrible mistake , aeur it doesnaeur ( tm ) t change the fact that five years ago he supported gadhafiaeur ( tm ) s removal . trump twisted clintonaeur ( tm ) s words when he claimed clinton said aeuroevets are being treated , essentially , just fine . aeur clinton said the problems in the department of veterans affairs were not as aeuroewidespreadaeur as some republican supporters of privatization of the va claim , but she went on to acknowledge problems in the va system aeur" including the issue of wait times for doctors aeur" and what she would do to address them . trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as aeuroeone of the big problemsaeur in the va , and then suggested clinton doesnaeur ( tm ) t think the va has problems . lauer interrupted , noting that clinton aeuroewent on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the va . aeur trump insisted his version was accurate , adding , aeuroeiaeur ( tm ) m telling you aeur|| she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the veterans administration . aeur thataeur ( tm ) s not accurate . the comments in question from clinton came during an interview with msnbcaeur ( tm ) s rachel maddow on oct . 23 , 2015 . maddow asked about talk among some republicans of abolishing the va and privatizing it . aeuroethe reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the va seem so intractable , aeur maddow said . maddow asked if clinton had any aeuroenew ideas for trying to fixaeur the va . here was clintonaeur ( tm ) s response , with the part trump is referring to in bold . clinton accused republicans of underfunding the va because they aeuroewant it to failaeur so they can privatize it . clinton added , aeuroebut we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern , so that we can try to stymie the republican assault . aeur indeed , the clinton campaign website states that clinton wants to aeuroefundamentally reform veteransaeur ( tm ) health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care . aeur the campaign says clinton aeuroewas outraged by the recent scandals at the va , and as president , she will demand accountability and performance from va leadership . aeur the site specifically mentions clintonaeur ( tm ) s dissatisfaction that aeuroe[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appealsaeur and promises she will aeuroe[b]uild a 21st-century department of veterans affairs to deliver world-class care . aeur trump cherry-picked the part of clintonaeur ( tm ) s response that said problems in the va have aeuroenot been as widespread as it has been made out to be , aeur to make the blanket claim that clinton is aeuroesatisfied with what was going on in the veterans administrationaeur and that aeuroevets are being treated , essentially , just fine . aeur but trump is leaving out the parts of clintonaeur ( tm ) s answer that acknowledged problems in the va aeur" including the wait time issue trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns . |,REAL
